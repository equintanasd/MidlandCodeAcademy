This is the homestretch!

As part of completing this Codecademy Pro Intensive program you’ll earn a Codecademy Credential, a digital letter of completion that acknowledges your earned progress throughout the course.

Criteria

Completion of all interactive course material within each unit – the lessons and projects.
Submission of all reviewable projects.

Note: In addition to marking items as complete in your dashboard, ensure that all checkpoints within your interactive learning environment are marked complete.

In order to receive your Codecademy Credential, please complete the above requirements within two weeks of your cohort's end date. We'll send your credential by email, within one week of this submission deadline.

We're so proud of you and what you've accomplished over the past several weeks! We look forward to seeing you succeed as you continue your coding journey.

Happy Learning!
