      /*

        1) Write a function called 'messageToUser' and have it accept
          one parameter: "text"
          - the function will simply use "alert" to display whatever text
          was passed into the function

        2) Write a function called 'changePassword'
          - in the function, ask the user for a new password and store
          it in a variable
          - Check to see IF the password is 'password'
            > IF it is, display a message about "Password can't be password"
          - Check the password's length
            > IF the password is longer than 8 characters, display a
            positive message to the user
            > IF the password is shorter, display a negative message
