    /*
      1) create a 'user' object with 4 properties:
        - username: string
        - password: string
        - current_bill: number
        - payment_history: array
      2) write a method on the 'user' object called 'messageToUser' that has one parameter: 'text'
        - should simply use the alert() method to display the text
      3) write a method on the 'user' object called 'payBill'
        A) First, this method should check to see if the current_bill is greater than 0
          - If it is less than or equal to zero, display "No bill" message to the user and return
        A) this function should tell the user what their current bill is and
          ask the user how much they would like to pay and store that number
          in a variable
        B) If no data was returned ( if(!amount) ) send message to the user and return
        C) make sure you're dealing with a number
          - prompt will return a string. Use parseInt() to turn a string into a number
        D) before accepting the payment, check to see if the payment amount is
          larger than the current bill amount
            - if its a greater amount, display error message to the user, call `this.payBill()` and then return
        E) subtract the payment amount from the current_bill and store the result
          on the object in the 'current_bill' key
        F) add the payment amount to the payment_history array
        G) thank them, display the payment amount back to the user, ask the user if they'd like to make another payment
          - if they do, call payBill() again
          - otherwise, thank them for their payment
      4) write a method on the user object called 'login'
        A) ask the user for their username and password, storing both of them in variables
        B) if they both are a match, call the 'payBill' method on the user object
        C) otherwise, tell them it was incorrect
          - and THEN call the login method again (giving them another chance)
      5) Outside of the object and any functions/methods, etc... call user.login() to begin the process

      // NEW STUFF
      - confirm()
        - https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_confirm.asp
      - 'this' keyword
        - "When a function is called as a method of an object, its this is set to the object the method is called on."

      - .push()

      - parseInt()

      EXTENDED PRACTICE
      ##########
      1) Create a new method on the user object called 'naviagte'
      2) prompt the user for their selection
        - Do you want to make a [payment] or [view] history or [exit]
        - If the selection isn't one of those items, display error message and call this.navigate() again
        - If the selection is 'payment', call this.payBill()
        - If the selection is 'view', alert out the string version of the payment_history array
          - Will use the toString() array method
        - If the selection is 'exit', tell them goodbye
      3) In the payBill() method, after they've chosen NOT to meke another payment, send them
        back to this.navigate() to let them chose an option
